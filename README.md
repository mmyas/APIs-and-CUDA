This repository also contains a collection of machine learning models designed to perform sentiment classification on app reviews. Specifically, it focuses on reviews from the IRCTC app, which were collected using the Google Play Store API. It has been preprocessed and labeled according to the star rating associated with each review.

- Fine-tuned GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2) provide good results with CUDA.
  
FastAPI example is also prepared.
